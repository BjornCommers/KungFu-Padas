      "8. What is the average age of passengers who survived?\n",
      "9. What is the average age of passengers who did not survive?\n",
      "10. At this (early) point in our analysis, what might you infer about any patterns you are seeing?\n",
      "11. How many passengers are in each of the three classes of service (e.g. First, Second, Third?)\n",
      "12. What is the survival rate for passengers in each of the three classes of service?\n",
      "13. Continuing with 10, what else might you conclude?\n",
      "14. Last, if we were to build a predictive model, which features in the data do you think we should include in the model and which can we leave out? Why?"

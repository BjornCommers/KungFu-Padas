2:  Rename the columns to:
['Survived', 'Class', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'ParCh', 'TicketId', 'Fare', 'Cabin', 'Embarked']


# 3: Tell me how many people survived. 

# 4: Of thoes who survived, how many were male and how many were female? 

# 5:  Pandas thinks the "Class" col is a number, but it should actually be a string.  So, covert the "Class" col to a string.
